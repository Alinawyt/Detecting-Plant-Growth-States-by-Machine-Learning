# Detecting Plant Growth States by Machine Learning

This project aims to develop an AI-based system for accurately detecting and classifying different growth stages of plants using computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms. The system's objective is to monitor and evaluate plant growth processes, which can be beneficial in agriculture and plant research.

## Methodology

### SVM Classification

Utilized histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature extraction combined with support vector machine (SVM) classification to classify plant growth stages. Achieved an accuracy of 80.77% on the test set.

### CNN Classification

Employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for both plant growth stage classification and abnormal leaf detection. Achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 97.44% for plant growth stage classification and 92.31% for abnormal leaf detection on the test sets.

## Results

This experiment demonstrates the accuracy of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, in classifying plant growth stages and identifying aberrant leaves. CNNs outperformed classic computer vision approaches, showcasing the power of deep learning in complex picture categorization problems.
