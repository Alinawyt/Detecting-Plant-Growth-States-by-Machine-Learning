# Detecting-Plant-Growth-States-by-Machine-Learning
This project proposal focuses on developing an Al-based system for accurately detecting and classifying different growth stages of plants. 

Detecting plant growth stages
1. Seeding stage：CV method, does not require a database
2. Growth stage： (insect pest, water shortage) ML
3. Mature stage： (multiple, single) ML?
